## T-036 Fix "Live update" notice sliding under the folded rail on phones (P03 follow-up)
- Requirement: on 390 px the Business OS "Live update" notice is partly hidden behind the folded navigation rail.
  It must sit fully inside the content area. Existed before P03.
- Files: likely `saas/ds/retheme.css` (no layout changes to other elements).

## T-035 Persistent autosave, checkpoint and resume system (P03.5)
- Requirement (owner prompt, 2026-10-30, summarised): persistent project memory in `CLAUDE.md` and
  `.claude/project-memory/` (MASTER_PLAN, PROGRESS, COMPLETED_TASKS, PENDING_TASKS, DECISIONS, ERROR_LOG,
  SESSION_HANDOVER, CHECKPOINTS); task IDs and statuses; checkpoints with timestamp, phase, task, steps, files, tests,
  branch, commit, errors, next action; automatic resume detection that verifies git state instead of trusting notes;
  handover before context runs out; atomic commits, no force-push, no automatic push without permission; failure
  recovery that never blindly retries migrations, payments, emails, deploys or external APIs; Claude Code hooks for
  startup and handover without loops; a recovery drill; no secrets in memory.

  `scripts/project-memory.test.mjs`, `package.json`.
- Acceptance: memory files present and validated; `npm run memory:checkpoint`, `memory:snapshot`, `memory:resume`,
  `memory:validate` work; SessionStart hook prints state; contract test passes inside `npm test`; recovery drill
  (start task → snapshot → lose working tree → new session → resume → finish without repeating) passes.
- Remaining: see SESSION_HANDOVER.md.
- Files changed: CLAUDE.md; .claude/settings.json; .claude/project-memory/*; scripts/memory/*; scripts/project-memory.test.mjs; docs/process/PROJECT_MEMORY.md; package.json

- Requirement: get the P02, P03 and P03.5 commits onto GitHub without touching main.
- Acceptance: branch `phase-03-cinematic-design` on GitHub matches the local branch; pull request into main open for the owner's review (no merge, no deploy).
- Evidence: branch phase-03-cinematic-design pushed to GitHub at 4d2c1c3 (matches local); pull request #33 into main opened for owner review; main untouched at 8318b9e; nothing merged or deployed (recorded 2026-10-30 on phase-03-cinematic-design at 4d2c1c3)

## T-039 Phase 04: complete Business Operating System integration
- Added: 2026-10-30
- Requirement: Owner prompt 2026-10-30 (full text in docs/phase-04/PROMPT.md). Use the Phase 00 inventory as mandatory preservation checklist; improve every existing module; complete broken or disconnected workflows. Subscriber workspace: dashboard, business setup, CRM/customers, enquiries, quotations, bookings, jobs, work orders, worker allocation, workforce compliance, offshore staff, AI receptionist, unified inbox, email and messaging, invoices, payments, accounting and GST, marketing, campaigns, social media, content studio, website management, SEO, AI approvals, files and documents, reports, analytics, branding, notifications, help and support, integrations, automation settings. Preserve pipeline Enquiry > Quote > Booking > Allocation > Completion > Invoice > Payment with correct propagation. Founder console: subscriber admin, organisation management, plans, platform billing, revenue analytics, infrastructure status, storage and backups, AI usage and costs, platform marketing, system email, support tickets, security and audit logs, feature flags, compliance, platform configuration; keep subscriber business comms separate from founder platform comms. Unified navigation, search, filters, notifications, activity history, AI assistance, file attachments, permissions, mobile. Never show success for a backend action that did not succeed. Every existing feature verified working or documented with blockers.
