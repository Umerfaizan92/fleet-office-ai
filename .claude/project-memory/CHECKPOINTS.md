# Checkpoints

Append-only log written by `npm run memory:checkpoint`. Each entry records timestamp, phase, task, completed and
incomplete steps, files, tests and results, branch, commit, recovery snapshot, known errors and the exact next action.
Do not edit past entries; add a new checkpoint to correct one.
